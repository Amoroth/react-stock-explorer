# Stock Explorer!
It's a website for looking at stocks and stuff...
It lets you search for specific company or show you a couple of suggested ones.
You can favorite them to save for later, review their prices and some other money making things, look at some graphs and read about the company and their financials.
It also let's you change currencies to make it easier for estimating how much money you will never see.
